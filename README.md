Overview of the Project
This project examines a recent animal study that Pymaceuticals, Inc. conducted to evaluate how well different medication cycles worked to treat mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). 249 mice were treated for 45 days in the trial, and the progression of their tumors was monitored at various intervals.

Comparing Capomulin, the medicine of interest from Pymaceuticals, against alternative therapies is the main goal. To find important insights, this investigation uses statistical modeling, summary statistics, data preparation, and visualization.
